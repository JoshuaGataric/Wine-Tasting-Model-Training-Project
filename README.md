# Wine-Tasting-Model-Training-Project
## This project demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to predict wine labels based on wine reviews. By leveraging text processing tools such as CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer, and employing models like LinearSVC and RandomForestClassifier, the project achieved meaningful insights into wine label prediction. The use of F1 macro average scores provided a balanced evaluation of the modelâ€™s precision and recall across different labels, while the confusion matrix visualization offered a deeper understanding of model performance and areas for improvement. Future work could involve exploring deeper models like neural networks, or incorporating more features from the wine reviews, such as reviewer characteristics or wine-specific attributes like price and region, to further enhance predictive performance.
